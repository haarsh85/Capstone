<br>3)Enter Area Name (eg.Dortmund):</br>
<br>4)Enter Zipcode:</br>
<br>5)Enter Weather (eg. Sunny, Windy, etc.):</br>
<br>6)Enter Energy Source ID (eg. ES001):</br>
<br>7)Enter Energy Source Name (eg.Solar, Hydro, Wind):</br>
<br>8)Enter Energy Capacity (eg.1000w):</br>
<br>9)Do you want to add more energy sources? (yes/no):(Continue if you want to add more energy sources)</br> 
<br>10)Do you want to add more locations? (yes/no): (Continue if you want to add more locations)</br>
<br>11)Enter Car Owner Name</br>
<br>12)Enter Car Number</br>

<br>All metadata of the logs file are being logged in Metadata.log file </br>
<br>Error occured in main method are being logged in ChargeStationMainLogs.txt</br>
<br>Error in charge station file are logged in ChargeStation.log file</br>
<br>Logs related to EnergySource are logged in EnergySource.log file</br>
<br>Log file related activity is being logged in ManageFile.txt</br><p>

<br>Please add JUnit 5 libraries in project build path to run JUnits</br>

<br>Description: In this task, have added junits for the classes already created.</br>
